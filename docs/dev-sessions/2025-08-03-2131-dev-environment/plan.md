# Session Plan

## Overview

This plan implements Kubernetes deployment for Hacky Stack in two phases: Basic setup (external PostgreSQL) and Intermediate setup (StatefulSet PostgreSQL). Each phase includes comprehensive documentation, interactive scripts, and learning resources.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Basic Setup

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure and Basic Kubernetes Manifests

**Prompt for LLM:**
```
Create the directory structure for Kubernetes deployment of Hacky Stack and implement basic Kubernetes manifests for the Next.js application.

Current project context:
- Next.js 15 application with TypeScript
- Uses NextAuth.js for GitHub OAuth authentication  
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Multi-stage Dockerfile already exists
- Runs on port 3000 with health checks

Tasks:
1. Create directory structure:
   - `k8s/basic/` - Basic level manifests
   - `k8s/intermediate/` - Intermediate level manifests (empty for now)
   - `docs/kubernetes/` - Documentation directory
   - `scripts/` - Shell scripts directory

2. Create basic Kubernetes manifests in `k8s/basic/`:
   - `namespace.yaml` - Dedicated namespace for the application
   - `deployment.yaml` - Next.js application deployment with:
     - 2 replicas for basic HA
     - Resource limits and requests
     - Health check probes
     - Security context (non-root user)
     - Environment variable placeholders
   - `service.yaml` - ClusterIP service exposing port 3000
   - `configmap.yaml` - Non-sensitive configuration template
   - `secret.yaml` - Sensitive data template (base64 encoded)

Requirements:
- Use proper Kubernetes labels and selectors
- Include comments explaining each resource
- Set appropriate resource limits (CPU: 100m-500m, Memory: 256Mi-512Mi)
- Configure readiness and liveness probes using the existing health check
- Use security best practices (non-root user, read-only filesystem where possible)
```

### Step 2: Create Ingress Configuration

**Prompt for LLM:**
```
