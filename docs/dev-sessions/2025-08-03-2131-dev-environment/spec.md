# Session Specification

## Objective

Create comprehensive documentation and scripts to run Hacky Stack in Minikube locally for Kubernetes learning and production environment simulation.

## Requirements

### Primary Goals
- Learn Kubernetes concepts through hands-on experience
- Simulate a production-like environment locally
- Progress from basic to intermediate Kubernetes complexity

### Technical Requirements

#### Level A: Basic Setup (Starting Point)
- Next.js application running in Kubernetes pods
- External PostgreSQL database (outside Minikube)
- Ingress controller with local domain (hackystack.local)
- ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration
- Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data (OAuth keys, session secrets)
- Interactive setup/teardown scripts with validation

#### Level B: Intermediate Setup (End Goal)
- PostgreSQL running as StatefulSet with persistent volumes
- Full Kubernetes-native data persistence
- Advanced configuration management
- Production-like architecture simulation

### Documentation Structure
- **Separate guides**: Basic setup guide first, then upgrade guide to intermediate
- **Learning-focused**: Comprehensive explanations of Kubernetes concepts
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues, kubectl commands, and debugging steps
- **Educational resources**: Next steps, additional learning materials, exercises

### Scripts and Automation
- **Interactive scripts** with user prompts and prerequisite validation
- **Deploy/update/cleanup** functionality
- **Configuration flexibility** with user choices
- **Error handling** and helpful feedback
