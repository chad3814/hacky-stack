## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Multi-Environment Setup
Create development, staging, and production namespaces:

```bash
# Create namespaces
kubectl create namespace hackystack-dev
kubectl create namespace hackystack-staging
kubectl create namespace hackystack-prod

# Deploy different configurations to each
# Use different resource limits, replica counts, and configurations
```

**Learning Objectives:**
- Namespace isolation
- Environment-specific configurations
- Resource quotas and limits

### Exercise 2: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
Set up automatic scaling based on CPU usage:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: hackystack-hpa
  namespace: hackystack
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: hackystack-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

**Learning Objectives:**
- Automatic scaling concepts
- Metrics server usage
- Performance testing and load generation

### Exercise 3: Blue-Green Deployment
Implement zero-downtime deployment strategy:

```bash
# Deploy v2 alongside v1
kubectl apply -f deployment-v2.yaml

# Test v2 deployment
kubectl port-forward deployment/hackystack-app-v2 3001:3000

# Switch traffic to v2
kubectl patch service hackystack-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"v2"}}}'

# Remove v1 after verification
kubectl delete deployment hackystack-app-v1
```

**Learning Objectives:**

- Traffic management
- Risk mitigation in deployments

### Exercise 4: Multi-Container Pods
Create a pod with sidecar containers:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:

spec:
  containers:
  - name: main-app
    image: hackystack:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3000
  - name: log-shipper
    image: fluent/fluent-bit:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - name: logs
      mountPath: /var/log
  volumes:

    emptyDir: {}
```

**Learning Objectives:**

  group: example.com
  versions:
  - name: v1
    served: true
    storage: true
    schema:
      openAPIV3Schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          spec:
            type: object
            properties:
              replicas:
                type: integer
              version:
                type: string
