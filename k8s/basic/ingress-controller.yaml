# NGINX Ingress Controller configuration for Minikube
# This file contains setup instructions and configuration

# To enable ingress in Minikube, run:
# minikube addons enable ingress

# This will install the NGINX Ingress Controller automatically.
# The controller watches for Ingress resources and configures
# the load balancer accordingly.

# For production environments, you would install the ingress controller
# using a more comprehensive manifest or Helm chart, but for learning
# purposes, the Minikube addon is sufficient.

# TLS Certificate for local development
# This creates a self-signed certificate for hackystack.local
